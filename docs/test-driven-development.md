# Test Driven Development

The main goal is to create tests that describe the functionality of the code. The test drive the development of the code.

## Process
- Create a failing unit test
- Fix the unit test in shortest time (doesn't have to be a proper fix)
- Repeat and add more tests that add more functionality to the code based on requirements.
